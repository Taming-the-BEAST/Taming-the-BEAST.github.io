	abstract="Reconstructing phylogenies through Bayesian methods has many benefits, which include providing a mathematically sound framework, providing realistic estimates of uncertainty and being able to incorporate different sources of information based on formal principles. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses are popular for interpreting nucleotide sequence data, however for such studies one needs to specify a site model and associated substitution model. Often, the parameters of the site model is of no interest and an ad-hoc or additional likelihood based analysis is used to select a single site model.",
